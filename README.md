# BearBones

BearBones is an application framework for creating software applications.

It provides a solid, transaction based Undo/Redo-system, MDI functionality, backwards-compatible serialization functionality, hotkey remapping, auto-saving and session restoration systems.

## Roadmap

BearBones is in an early state.

Future versions will include:

- Native saving and loading.
- Better clipboard support, allowing to store and restore image data to the system clipboard.
- HiDPI theme support.

## How to use

BearBones uses a plugin system to define the behaviour of your app.
